They didn’t know how to use fire and ate everything raw. In that age there was no fine food and cooking. About 50,000 years ago, one Chinese ancestor, Suiren, who was the head of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, invented “manual wood drilling to make fire”, which started the era of cooked food. By the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC), “Eight Delicacies” appeared, which indicated that cooking had become an art. During the Eastern Zhou Dynasty to Qin Dynasty (770 – 207BC), four major cuisines, Shandong Cuisine, Jiangsu Cuisine, Guangdong Cuisine and Sichuan Cuisine were successively born. From the Han Dynasty (202-220 BC) to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), people in the central plains gradually blended their food with the ingredients from the western regions and the flavor of the minorities in the northwest, making the food more abundant. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasty (1636-1912), the “Eight Cuisines” gradually formed, each with distinct features.
